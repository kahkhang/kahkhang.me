# Hello World!

I'm Andrew, and I am currently a senior at [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.scs.cmu.edu/), majoring in [Computer Science](https://csd.cs.cmu.edu/content/bachelors-curriculum-admitted-2014) with a minor in [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/prospective-students/minor-in-machine-learning.html).

I like creating software to solve challenging problems, and I believe in Computer Science as a tool to make a world a better and smarter place.

Iâ€™ve interned as a software engineer at [Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co/en-sg), where I built a [social commerce app](https://easy.ninjavan.co/) featuring on-demand pickup and delivery. I've also worked at [AKELES Consulting](https://www.akeles.com/), where I built a number of popular [JIRA plugins](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/vendors/105/akeles-consulting).

You can find out more about me [here](cv/AndrewLow.pdf), view my past [projects](projects/), or just say [hi](mailto:kahkhang@gmail.com).

This site is hosted using Kubernetes on Linode (see [Kube-Linode](https://github.com/kahkhang/kube-linode)).
